- change gtk-3.00 to orange, or make sure it is fine
- make sure dark themes are working as well
- add instruction on how to use the themes without theme manager (i3, add .gtkrc to $HOME?)
- modify light theme so that dark background is not that dark
- add a flag to build either the daark or light theme, or somehow make to swithc between them easier for i3
- clean up unneeded stuff
- make light theme with dark scrollbar
- gtk-2 and gtk-3.0 stuff so it works with everything no tonly firefox :V
- scrollbar background is too dark!
