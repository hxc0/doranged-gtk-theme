- change gtk-3.00 to orange
- change install script so that themes install in $HOME/.themes not in /usr/share/themes
- make sure dark themes are working as well
- add instruction on how to use the themes without theme manager (i3, add .gtkrc to $HOME?)
- modify light theme so that dark background is not that dark
